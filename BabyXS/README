I am no expert in XS, nor am I am expert in C, but events conspired to force me to learn. What I found is that while XS can be used as a language all its own, it can also look and feel very much like C.

In this talk I will present a minimal subset of XS needed to get started. I will present some "easy" idioms and rules-of-thumb to keep XS from becoming overwhelming. Best of all, its still real XS, so you can add all the full-power XS you want later! 

If you would like to learn enough to start a small XS project, come see this talk.
